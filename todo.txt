add more checks to arg parsing

start thinking about how to combine alignments from the Pareto front
to create local ones. Should try to take from the best representatives of
the whole front-- might want to look at distance in alignment space as well
as objective space to do so.

add logging of mean and max over time for plotting purposes


Try starting with only very small alignment sizes and force it to start
from nothing as it does with ICS and bitscore.

label objectives better when displaying verbose stats

REFACTORING
-----------
use doSwap function in crossover constructor
